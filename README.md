## TODO Updates:
Instagram API Should put the last (or random middle) frame of the timelapse as the thumbnail...
Pass the name of the pot to the GPT caption generator
Pass an image of th epot 


System Ideas:
Autopotter Bot itself should upload occasional images of the pot to see if its working and have a little personality gage that takes input and outputs little gifs that play on the screen 

What's next?
Constrain the output better..

Render command:
