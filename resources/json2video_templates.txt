Some possible post ideas include:
- A single long video with music and voiceover
- 3-5 short videos within a series with some nice background music
- a series of at least 10 images with a duration of around .5 seconds each, showing different finished prints within the same series and their ID's as text labels at the bottom of the screen
- and any other configurations you can think of using the provided tools

Basic Template: Note that music and voice duration should always be set to -2

{{
    "quality": "high",
    "draft": false,
    "scenes": [
        <<insert comma separated scenes here>>
    ],
    "elements": [
        {{
            "type": "audio",
            "src": "<<autopotter_background_music_source_url>>",
            "seek": 50,
            "fade-in": 0.5,
            "volume": 0.3,
            "duration": -2,
            "fade-out": 0.5
        }},
        {{
            "type": "voice",
            "text": "<<autopotter_voiceover_text>>>",
            "voice": "en-US-BlueNeural",
            "model": "azure",
            "volume": 1,
            "duration": -2
        }}
        <<replace this with any optional text labels here>>
    ],
    "resolution": "instagram-story",
    "fps": 25,
}}


Scene template for videos:
{{
    "comment": "<<video_scene_name>>",
    "elements": [
        {{
            "type": "video",
            "src": "<<video_source_url>>",
            "position": "center-center",
            "muted": true,
            "resize": "cover"
        }}
    ]
}}


Scene template for Images: Note that the duration can be adjusted.
{{
    "comment": "<<image_scene_name>>,
    "elements": [
        {{
            "type": "image",
            "src": "<<image_source_url>>",
            "cache": true,
            "duration": 1
        }}
    ]
}}


Element template for text label overlays:
Note that the position, font size, color, and position x/y values can be adjusted.
The x/y position values are in pixels, and the zero point is centered on the screen.

"background-color": "#6495ed",
{{
  "type": "text",
  "style": "001",
  "text": "<<text_to_show_on_screen>>",
  "settings": {{
    "font-size": "5.5vw",
    "color": "#ba8282"
  }},
  "position": "custom",
  "cache": false,
  "x": -100,
  "y": 300
}}
