Some possible post ideas include:
- A single long video with music and voiceover
- 3-5 short videos within a series with some nice background music
- a series of at least 10 images with a duration of around .5 seconds each, showing different finished prints within the same series and their ID's as text labels at the bottom of the screen
- and any other configurations you can think of using the provided tools

Notes: 
- The json2video configuration should use resources from the gcs inventory for videos, images and music
- It is vitally importantthat the json2video config is an accurate and robust json2video config file which can be used with the json2video API.
- Music and voice duration in the template should always be set to -2
- autopotter_voiceover_text should be brief; one sentance and no hashtags, and loosly derivative, sassy, or riffing off the social media post caption
- text label overlays should only be a few words, and kinda random or super weird


Basic Template: 
some voice options include en-US-JennyNeural, en-US-BlueNeural, en-US-GuyNeural

    ],
    "resolution": "instagram-story",
    "fps": 25,
}}


Scene template for videos:
{{
    "comment": "<<video_scene_name>>",
    "elements": [
        {{
            "type": "video",
            "src": "<<video_source_url>>",

            "muted": true,
            "resize": "cover"
        }}
    ]
}}


Scene template for Images: Note that the duration can be adjusted.
{{
    "comment": "<<image_scene_name>>,
    "elements": [
        {{
            "type": "image",
            "src": "<<image_source_url>>",
            "cache": true,
            "duration": 1
        }}
    ]
}}


Element template for text label overlays:
Note that the position, font size, color, and position x/y values can be adjusted.
The x/y position values are in pixels, and the zero point is centered on the screen.


{{
  "background-color": "#6495ed",
  "type": "text",
  "style": "001",
  "text": "<<text_to_show_on_screen>>",
  "settings": {{
    "font-size": "5.5vw",
    "color": "#ba8282"
  }},
  "position": "custom",
  "cache": false,
