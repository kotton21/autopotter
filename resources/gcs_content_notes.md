Extra notes on gcs content:
All the photos in the gcs video_uploads folder are from freshly finished prints, and their names correspond to the print timelapse video that was just completed.
The size of the videos correlates roughly to the duration, so give preference to shorter videos when putting multiple in series.

The naming convention usually has a print id for each series:
TU indicates a tumbler. A small tumlber cup with no handle and spiral designs.
TA is a tall tumbler cup with more digital forms
TM is a Martini Tumbler. Its a martini glass with no stem.
SV loosly stands for Summer Vase, or spline vase. It's the first series which used splines to create the surface textures
RV is Random Vase. It's fully random shapes with a smooth texture.
SM stands for Spline Mug. It's a spline based mug using cross sections to build the shapes.
