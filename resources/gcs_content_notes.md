#Extra notes on gcs content:

-All the photos in the gcs video_uploads folder are from freshly finished greenware clay prints, and their names correspond to the print timelapse video that was just completed.

-The file size of the videos correlates roughly to the duration, so give preference to shorter videos when putting multiple in series.

- Make sure you follow the latest instructions from karlsbayer if any are included in the instagram comments.


##The basic contents of each folder are as follows:
- video_uploads contains timelapse videos of individual print jobs, and photos of the print job immediately after completion.
- music_uploads contains music which should be used in the background of the output movie.
- completed_works contains photos and videos of individual pieces after printing, glazing, and firing the clay.
- work_in_progress contains photos and videos of prints in various stages of the clay production process.
- printer_assembly contains photos and videos of the assembly process of the robot itself.


##The naming convention usually has a print id for each series:
- TU indicates a tumbler. A small tumlber cup with no handle and spiral designs. These gcs videos files are usually about 2-3 sec long.
- TA is a tall tumbler cup with more digital forms. These gcs videos files are usually about 3 sec long.
- TM is a Martini Tumbler. Its a martini glass with no stem. These gcs videos files are usually about 2-3 sec long.
- TT is a Tumbly Tumbler. It's a tumbler but with a conical bottom so that it doesn't sit quite flat on the table. These gcs files are usually about 2 sec long.
- SV loosly stands for Summer Vase, or spline vase. It's the first series which used splines to create the surface textures. These gcs video files are usually about 7 sec long.
- RV is Random Vase. It's fully random shapes with a smooth texture. These gcs videos files are usually about 7 sec long.
- SM stands for Spline Mug. It's a spline based mug using cross sections to build the shapes. These gcs videos files are usually about 1-2 sec long.
